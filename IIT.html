                <p class="tem-IIT">
                    I am currently in my first year of computer engineering at the International Institute of
                    Technology,
                    and I can already say that my experience here has been amazing. From the very beginning, I’ve been
                    welcomed into an environment that focuses on academic excellence and innovation. The courses are
                    well-structured, and although they are challenging, the professors are always available to help and
                    guide us.<br><br>

                    One aspect that particularly impressed me is the practical approach to teaching. From the first
                    year,
                    we’ve had hands-on projects in the lab that allowed us to apply the theoretical concepts we learn in
                    class. For example, in an IoT project, I had the chance to work with sensors and develop real
                    technological solutions to address specific problems.<br><br>

                    Additionally, the atmosphere at IIT is very international. I’ve met students from different
                    countries,
                    and this has allowed me to broaden my horizons while exchanging ideas and diverse approaches. This
                    experience has shown me how important global perspectives are, especially in a field as global as
                    computer science.<br><br>

                I’m also very impressed by IIT's modern infrastructure. The labs are equipped with cutting-edge
                technologies, which allows us to work with state-of-the-art tools, perfectly preparing us for the
                professional world.<br><br>
                Overall, my first semester at IIT has been very enriching, and I’m excited to continue my journey
                here,
                develop my skills, and contribute to innovative projects that will have a real-world impact.<br><br>
